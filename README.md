# ExpressJS test server

The objective with this one is to have a small NodeJS ready to be launch whenever I want.

* Clone the repo
* Run `yarn`
* Then open `index.js` and change/add the stuff you want.
* Finally, run `yarn start` and start using the server


### Notes
* no nodemon for this one.
* check your node version (just in case) before running `yarn`. The console might show some warnings about it 🤷🏽‍♂️.
